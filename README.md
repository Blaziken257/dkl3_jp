# Donkey Kong GB: Dinky Kong & Dixie Kong disassembly

This is a partial diassembly which builds a ROM of Donkey Kong GB: Dinky Kong & Dixie Kong (the Japanese GBC-only version of Donkey Kong Land III). This does not build the retail GB-only English versions.

# Building

To build, you need:

- A retail ROM in `baseroms/baserom_dkl3_jp.gbc`. This disassembly does not provide one so you must dump it yourself. The md5sum is `22AFE691095C65F34AEABA3C283B2A9C`
- rgbds. This was built for version 0.9.1 so older versions are unsupported.
